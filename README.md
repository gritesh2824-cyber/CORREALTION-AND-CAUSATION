 #📊 Correlation vs Causation – Data Analysis Notebook

This project explains and demonstrates the *difference between correlation and causation* using examples, visualizations, and simple data analysis.  
The goal is to clarify a common misconception in *statistics, data science, and machine learning*.

## 📌 Project Objective

Many variables may appear related (correlated), but that does *not* mean one causes the other.  
This notebook aims to:

- Explain *correlation* and *causation*
- Show why correlation does *not imply* causation
- Use examples and plots to build intuition
- Highlight common pitfalls in data interpretation

---
